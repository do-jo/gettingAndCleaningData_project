# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This repo contains project data for the Coursera.org Data Science specialization course: "Getting and Cleaning Data."

This repo includes:

1. run_analysis.R: to create tidy data from wearable computing data collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphone users (30 subjects). Tidy data is achieved in 5 steps and aims to summarize the mean and standard deviation measurements by subject and activity type.

2. CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean the data.

# Running the code
Download the data using the URL in the CodeBook. Execute run_analysis.R in R with the dataset in the working directory.
